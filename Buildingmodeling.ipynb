    "## Introduction \n",
    "The aim of this project is to model the heat exchange of 2 rooms inside a building, to understand the thermal behavior of it. Nowadays, energy efficiency is a key pillar of the net-zero race, and building thermal modeling is a subject which has gained relevance. The limitations of this discipline is strongly correlated to the decarbonization targets set by governments. The building sector represents around 44% of the final energy consumption in France, meaning there is a huge potential for energy savings if thermal improvements are put in place. An in-depth understanding of a thermal model of a building is relevant to improve its overall efficiency. "

    "### Hyphotesis\n",
    "The report examines the thermal model-based building energy calculations. The following presumptions are included: \n",
    "- This model excludes the floor and ceiling heat transfer\n",
    "- Inner building surroundings to the rooms are considered neglectable, having only heat transfer from the outside and in between room 1 and 2\n",
    "- All forms of heat transmission are addressed linearly, even radiative exchange\n",
    "- Heat transport is unidirectional since the length and height of a wall is much bigger than the width \n",
    "- It is assumed that the temperature is distributed equally throughout each surface\n",

    "For this case study, we modeled 2 rooms, 42 and 36 $m^2$, respectively, separated by an internal door. Both rooms will have a window to the exterior, room 1 a door connecting to the outside, and room 2 will have mechanical ventilation. The diagram is exposed in Figure 1. \n",

    "\n",
    "Using the dimensions of the internal and external walls, doors and windows, in conjunction with the material properties, we are able to propose a thermal model, represented by a circuit. \n",
    "\n",
    "Due to a temperature difference, constitutive laws and transport phenomena in energy balance following thermodynamic principles, we, by analogy, can create a thermal circuit constituted by branches, nodes, temperature sources, heat flow sources, resistance and capacitances. \n",

    "### Nodes \n",
    "\n",
    "For each node, a specific temperature is associated. A heat flow source can come from wall surfaces and its inner heat capacity of a wall, in J/kg, given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$C_w= m_w c_w= \\rho_w c_w w_w S_w$$\n",

    "A branch will represent a heat flow due to conduction, convection, radiation and advection phenomena. For practicality, conductance will be used instead of resistance. The three main sources of conductance are conduction, convection, and radiation, described below: \n",

    "A temperature source is an independent variable from the thermal circuit due to outdoor air temperature, setpoint temperature by HVAC and temperatures from adjacent spaces.
